========= jFirm 0.2.5 (2009-07-10) =========
* Fix quadratic runtime in topological walker

========= jFirm 0.2.4 (2009-07-09) =========
* Add Graph.walkTopological() - a walker that guarantees that all nodes inside
  a basic block are visited in a topological order (but multiple blocks might
  still be interleaved)

========= jFirm 0.2.3 (2009-06-18) =========
* Add Graph.notifyControlFlowChange so things don't fail when optimisations
  change the controlflow

========= jFirm 0.2.2 (2009-06-18) =========
* Graph.newXXX takes a Node instead of a Block for the block input now (using
   Bad is allowed and this is more consistent with Node.getBlock())
* Add missing TargetValue.compare function
* Create a helper Enum to deal with Cmp Proj numbers
* Added Program.getConstCodeGraph(), Node.setBlock()
* Experimental new function Graph.copyNode
* fix bugs related to ConstCodeGraphs

========= jFirm 0.2.1 (2009-06-03) ==========
* Fix Type.getMode() throwing NullPointer exceptions for types without modes
* Make layoutFields set the size of a class Type
* sync/update nodespecification/node classes with firm 

========= jFirm 0.2.0 (2009-06-03) ==========
* Includes a windows dll now
* Moved some functions from Util class to Graph class (exchange, killNode, turnIntoTuple)
* Reworked visitor/graph walk interface. It is now using the visitor pattern (use DefaultVisitor to port old code)
 
=========  jFirm 0.1.3 ==========
* Fixed mac dylib

========= jFirm 0.1.2 ==========
* Cleanup
* More Documentation, added README

========= jFirm 0.1.1 ==========
* Includes jna.jar now
* Includes firm brainfuck compiler example
* A new hack to catch C asserts from java on OS/X

========= jFirm 0.1.0 ==========
* Initial revision
