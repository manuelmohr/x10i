/**
 * @file
 * @brief       Representation and computation of the callgraph.
 * @author      Goetz Lindenmaier
 * @date        21.7.2004
 * @version     $Id$
 * @brief
 *  This file contains the representation of the callgraph.
 *  The nodes of the call graph are ir_graphs.  The edges between
 *  the nodes are calling relations.  I.e., if method a calls method
 *  b at some point, there is an edge between a and b.
 *
 *  Further this file contains an algorithm to construct the call
 *  graph.  The construction of the callgraph uses the callee
 *  information in Call nodes to determine which methods are called.
 *
 *  Finally this file contains an algorithm that computes backedges
 *  in the callgraph, i.e., the algorithm finds possibly recursive calls.
 *  The algorithm computes an upper bound of all recursive calls.
