/**
 * @file
 * @brief   Flags to control optimizations.
 * @author  Christian Schaefer, Goetz Lindenmaier, Michael Beck
 * @version $Id$
 * @brief
 * Flags to customize the behavior of libfirm.
 *
 * There are the following groups of flags:
 * 1. Optimization flags.
 *    a)  There is a flag, 'optimize' to turn on/off all optimizations.
 *    b)  There are flags for each individual optimization.  Some flags turns
 *        transformations in several algorithms on/off.
 * 2. Normalization flags.
 *    These flags steer transformations of the ir that improve it, as removing
 *    dump Phi nodes (one predecessor, all predecessors are equal ...), Ids, Tuples ...
 * 3. Verbosity flags.
 *    a) Flags to steer the level of the information.
 *    b) Flags to steer in which phase information should be dumped.
 * 4. Verification flag
 *    This one controls the behavior of node and type verifications
