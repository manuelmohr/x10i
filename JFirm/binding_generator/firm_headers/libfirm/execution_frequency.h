/**
 * @file
 * @brief    Compute an estimate of basic block executions.
 * @author   Goetz Lindenmaier
 * @date     5.11.2004
 * @version  $Id$
 * @brief
 * We assume the start block of a procedure is executed once.  Based on this we
 * compute the execution freqency of all blocks.
 *
 * The computation of the frequencies depends on the count of exception control
 * flow computed during the interval analysis. The interval analysis again
 * depends on stuff computed here.
