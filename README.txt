This repository tracks a whole Eclipse workspace, since we need to track five projects at once.

== Eclipse Import ==

1. point your Eclipse workspace to this directory
2. click "File" -> "Import ..."
3. select "General" -> "Existing projects into workspace"
4. select current workspace as root directory (click "browse" and "ok" should be enough)
5. all five projects should be selected (x10.common, x10.compiler, x10.constraints, x10.dist, x10.runtime)
6. click "Finish"

Now all projects should be imported into your Eclipse workspace.
The inter-project relationships should already be set correctly.
